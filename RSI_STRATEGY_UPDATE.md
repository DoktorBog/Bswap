# RSI Strategy Update - Auto-Sell Configuration

## Changes Made

### ✅ Removed Time-Based Selling
- **NO** periodic sells every 3-4 seconds  
- **NO** forced sells after X minutes of holding
- **NO** sell delays between transactions

### ✅ Kept RSI-Based Auto-Selling
RSI strategy now sells ONLY based on technical indicators:

1. **RSI Overbought (> 70)** - Sells when RSI exceeds 70
2. **RSI Bearish Divergence** - Sells when price rises but RSI falls
3. **RSI Crosses Above 50** - Takes profit when RSI crosses from below to above neutral

### ❌ Removed Features
- `canSellNow()` - 3 second delay between sells
- Timed sells after `minHoldMs`
- Force sells after `minHoldMs * 10`
- Extended hold time fallback selling

## How It Works Now

```
BUY Logic:
- Buys when RSI < 30 (oversold)
- Buys whitelisted tokens only

SELL Logic:  
- Sells ONLY on RSI signals (overbought, divergence, etc)
- No time-based selling
- No periodic selling
- Sells immediately when RSI signal triggers
```

## Configuration

In `RsiBasedConfig`:
```kotlin
val oversoldThreshold = 30.0   // Buy when RSI < 30
val overboughtThreshold = 70.0 // Sell when RSI > 70
val minHoldMs = 3_000          // Not used for auto-sell anymore
```

## Summary

The RSI strategy now:
- ✅ Buys based on RSI oversold signals
- ✅ Sells based on RSI overbought/divergence signals  
- ❌ Does NOT sell based on time
- ❌ Does NOT have delays between sells
- ❌ Does NOT force sell after holding period

All selling is now purely based on RSI technical analysis!
