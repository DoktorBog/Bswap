/**
 * Enhanced Jito Bundle Debugging Test Script
 * 
 * This script helps analyze the Jito bundler logs to identify:
 * 1. Where tip transaction creation fails
 * 2. Where HTTP requests to Jito endpoints fail
 * 3. Whether bundles are actually being sent to URLs
 * 
 * The enhanced logging should now show:
 * - ‚úÖ Created tip tx to=... - confirms tip transaction creation
 * - === ATTEMPTING HTTP POST to ... === - confirms HTTP attempt
 * - === HTTP RESPONSE RECEIVED from ... === - confirms HTTP response
 * - ‚ùå ERROR - shows any failure points
